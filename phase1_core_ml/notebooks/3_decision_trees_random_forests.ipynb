    "# Decision Trees & Random Forests from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome, St. Mark!** Now we explore tree-based methods. Think of this as building diagnostic decision trees - like the flowchart doctors use to diagnose illnesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Tree Construction** - Building trees through recursive splitting\n",
    "2. **Splitting Criteria** - Gini impurity and information gain\n",
    "3. **Random Forests** - Ensemble learning through bagging\n",
    "4. **Feature Importance** - Understanding which features matter most\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll understand how ensemble methods achieve remarkable accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Definitions and Mathematical Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree:** A non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that partitions the feature space into regions and assigns each region a constant prediction value. Unlike parametric models (like logistic regression), decision trees adapt their complexity to the data structure without assuming any specific form of the relationship between features and target.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components of a Decision Tree:**\n",
    "- **Root Node:** The topmost node representing the entire training dataset and the first decision point\n",
    "- **Internal Nodes:** Nodes that split data based on a feature threshold, creating decision branches\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes:** Terminal nodes that provide final predictions (majority class for classification)\n",
    "- **Branches:** Decision paths connecting nodes based on whether feature values are ≤ or > a threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees through bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and feature randomness to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. The final prediction is typically the majority vote across all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gini Impurity:** A quadratic measure of node impurity that quantifies how \"mixed\" a node is with respect to class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Gini}(D) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $D$: Dataset at current node\n",
    "- $c$: Number of classes\n",
    "- $p_i$: Proportion of samples belonging to class $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** Lower Gini = more pure node (better for splitting). A Gini of 0 means all samples in the node belong to the same class (perfect purity), while a Gini of 0.5 (for binary classification) represents maximum impurity (50-50 class distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entropy:** An alternative logarithmic measure of information content and impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formula:**\n",
    "$$\\text{Entropy}(D) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \\log_2(p_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Gain:** The reduction in impurity achieved by splitting a node on a particular feature. The algorithm selects the split that maximizes information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Information Gain}(D, A) = \\text{Impurity}(D) - \\sum_{v \\in \\text{values}(A)} \\frac{|D_v|}{|D|} \\cdot \\text{Impurity}(D_v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $D$: Parent dataset\n",
    "- $A$: Feature to split on\n",
    "- $D_v$: Subset of $D$ where feature $A$ has value $v$\n",
    "\n",
    "**CART Algorithm:** Classification and Regression Trees - the specific algorithm we implement, characterized by:\n",
    "1. **Binary Splits:** Each internal node splits in exactly two child nodes\n",
    "2. **Greedy Algorithm:** Selects best split at each step using information gain\n",
    "3. **Impurity Minimization:** Uses Gini impurity (or optionally entropy) for split quality\n",
    "4. **Stopping Criteria:** Maximum depth, minimum samples per split, or pure nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are flowchart-like structures for classification:\n",
    "- **Root Node:** Starting decision point\n",

    "- **Binary decisions:** \"Is blood pressure ≤ 140?\" vs \"Is it ≤ 138 or ≤ 142?\"\n",
