    "### 1.1 What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. The agent receives **rewards** or **penalties** based on its actions and learns to maximize cumulative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- **Agent**: The decision-maker (e.g., LLM in DeepSeek-R1)\n",
    "- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with (e.g., reasoning tasks)\n",
    "- **State (s)**: Current situation of the environment\n",
    "- **Action (a)**: What the agent can do\n",
    "- **Reward (r)**: Immediate feedback from environment\n",
    "- **Policy (π)**: Strategy that maps states to actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Think of RL like teaching a dog tricks:\n",
    "- The dog is the **agent**\n",
    "- Your commands and the physical world are the **environment**\n",
    "- The dog's position, your gestures are the **state**\n",
    "- Barking, sitting, fetching are **actions**\n",
    "- Treats are **positive rewards**, scolding is **negative reward**\n",
    "- The dog's learned behavior is the **policy**\n"
