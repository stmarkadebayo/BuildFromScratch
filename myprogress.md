# Build From Scratch Progress Tracker

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Core Machine Learning Foundations

### Phase 1.1 - Linear Regression (Batch + SGD)
- [x] Created linear_regression_from_scratch.ipynb notebook
- [x] Enhanced with comprehensive explanations and detailed comments
- [x] Implement OLS closed-form solution
- [x] Implement gradient descent algorithms (Batch, Mini-batch, SGD)
- [x] Compare with scikit-learn
- [x] Visualize loss convergence
- [x] Added reflection questions and healthcare analogies

### Upcoming Topics
- Phase 1.2: Logistic Regression (Binary & Multiclass)
- Phase 1.3: Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Phase 1.4: KNN, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- Phase 1.5: Naive Bayes & SVM
- Phase 1.6: PCA & Dimensionality Reduction
- Phase 1.7: Regularization: L1, L2, Dropout
- Phase 1.8: Gradient Descent Variants: Momentum, Adam, RMSProp

## Learning Goals
- Build intuition for optimization and generalization
- Master algorithmic design in ML
- Understand the mathematics behind each algorithm
- Implement from scratch before using libraries

## Schedule
- Target 1-2 weeks per major topic in Phase 1
- Practice implementation and debugging
- Compare results and analyze differences
